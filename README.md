# Multiboxer Classic
My Wow 1.12.1 multiboxer converted and trimmed down to work with Wow Classic, and with a little extra functionality.

# How to compile
- Download the source .zip, extract it
- open Multiboxer.sln in Visual Studio 2017
- Press Build -> Build Solution
- Open Multiboxer/bin/Debug/Multiboxer.exe
- Done!

# How it works
- Uses WINAPI messages to send keystrokes all open wow clients
- Requires you to select a client that you will be playing on (the Master Client)
- Will not send keystrokes to the Master

# Features
- Basic blacklisting/whitelisting capabilities
- Ability to concurrently play as many clients as you want
- Functional key broadcasting, including multi-key keystrokes (ex. Shift+C)
