# Multiboxer Classic
Simple, easy to use Multiboxer for World of Warcraft (written for Classic) with features comparable to some well-known paid Multiboxer software.

# How to compile
- Download the source .zip, extract it (or clone the project)
- Open Multiboxer.sln in Visual Studio 2022 (VS 2019 will also work)
- Press Build -> Build Solution
- Open Multiboxer/bin/Debug/Multiboxer.exe
- Done!

# How it works
- In the Multiboxing tab, requires you to select a client that you will be playing on (the Master Client)
- Uses WINAPI messages to send keystrokes all open wow clients except the selected master
- The Key Configuration tab allows you to blacklist or whitelist certain keys, as well as enable/disable certain keystrokes/mouse clicks that will be translated into other keys for ease of use
- For the keystroke/mouse click translation options, the in-game macros must be bound to the correct keys which will be pressed when translating (ex. Left Mouse Button pressed -> assist macro (F12))

# Features
- Basic blacklisting/whitelisting capabilities
- Ability to concurrently play as many clients as you want
- Functional key broadcasting, including multi-key keystrokes (ex. Shift+C)
- Functional mouse click broadcasting
- Variety of keystroke/mouse click translation options
- List of basic essential multiboxing Macros that are copy+paste ready and which correspond to the keystroke translation options
- Inconspicuous window name for some basic detection avoidance :^)
- More in-depth help available for each tab within the software
